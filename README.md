The project_script.py file contains a multi-stage address matching pipeline
to reconcile apartment address records between two large datasets: CCS (Customer Cloud Service) and GIS (Geographical Information System)
The system combines fuzzy string matching, semantic similarity using Sentence-BERT, and geospatial filtering to identify high confidence
matches across noisy and inconsistent data, significantly improving data integrity across systems.
